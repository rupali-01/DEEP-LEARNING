# Deep Learning Practical

This repository contains lab practicals from the **Deep Learning** course at my institution. It covers key topics such as Logistic Regression, Cost & Loss Functions, Gradient Descent, CNNs, and Regularization through hands-on implementations.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

### 1. **HR Folder ‚Äì Logistic Regression**
   - **Dataset**: `HR_comma_sep.csv`  
   - **Objective**: Binary classification to predict employee outcomes (e.g., attrition).  
   - **Concepts**: Logistic Regression, data preprocessing, evaluation metrics.

### 2. **Insurance Folder ‚Äì Cost & Loss Functions, Gradient Descent & Regularization**
   - **Datasets**: `insurance_data.csv`, `new_insurance_data.csv`  
   - **Objective**: Implement and analyze cost functions (MSE, Cross-Entropy), gradient descent optimization, and regularization techniques (L1/L2).  

### 3. **Potato Disease Folder ‚Äì CNN for Image Classification**
   - **Dataset**: Subset of the [PlantVillage dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arajmishra/potato-dataset?resource=download) (potato leaf images).  
   - **Objective**: Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify potato leaf diseases (e.g., Early Blight, Late Blight, Healthy).  
   - **Concepts**: CNN architecture, data augmentation, transfer learning (optional).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Jupyter notebook 
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras.
